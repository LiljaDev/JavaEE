# JavaEE
2018 course in Java EE development. 

There were two exams in this course. The first was a screencast of developing a demo and discussing an assigned topic(each student had a unique topic). My delivery can be seen here: https://youtu.be/kDGVb2A6hL0. <br>
The second was an individual 30 minute interview where the examinator questioned each student about different Java EE related topics which landed me a grade B(JPA, Transactions, Web services..).
